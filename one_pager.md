*[Your Name], [Your University/Department]*  

---  
## Project Context  
Proposing a biologically-constrained CNN framework for geographic classification of malaria parasites through DNA sequence analysis. This academic exploration demonstrates:  

- Mastery of genomic ML concepts  
- Ability to design biologically-informed architectures  
- Experience with large-scale genomic data pipelines  
- Rigorous approach to model validation  

*Currently awaiting MalariaGEN Pf7 dataset access to validate implementation*

## Technical Innovation  
Designed a DNA-aware CNN architecture with:  

```python
# Proposed Architecture
model = DNACNN(
    strand_type="symmetric",  # Reverse-complement equivariance
    positional_enc="chromosomal",  # Chromosomal context integration
    attention="hierarchical",  # Multi-scale feature weighting
    noise_layers="variant_sim"  # Realistic noise simulation
)
```

| Biological Constraint    | Technical Implementation       | Validation Plan          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| DNA strand symmetry      | Mirror-weight convolutions     | Reverse complement tests |
| Chromosomal context      | Learnable position embeddings  | Attention pattern analysis |
| Sparse mutations         | TF-IDF + sparse encoding       | Synthetic variant recovery |
| Sequencing noise         | Augmentation layers            | Noise robustness benchmarks |

## Academic Value Demonstration  

**Key Contributions**  
1. Novel integration of CNN architectures with genomic constraints  
2. Framework for biologically-plausible ML in pathogen surveillance  
3. Modular design enabling extension to other genomic tasks  

**Implementation Readiness**  
- Complete pipeline architecture  
- Preprocessing modules tested on synthetic data  
- Model prototypes implemented in PyTorch  
- Validation suite prepared ([github.com/yourrepo](https://github.com/yourrepo))  

## Immediate Goals  

1. **Empirical Validation**  
   - Execute on MalariaGEN Pf7 dataset (access pending)  
   - Compare against phylogenetic baseline methods  

2. **Academic Extensions**  
   - Spatial-temporal transmission modeling  
   - Interpretable biomarker discovery  
   - Ethical framework for genomic surveillance  

## Seeking Collaboration  

I am particularly interested in discussing:  

- **Transfer Learning** approaches for low-data regions  
- Integration with **Phylogenetic Methods**  
- **Ethical Considerations** in genomic epidemiology  
- Practical challenges in **Real-World Deployment**
