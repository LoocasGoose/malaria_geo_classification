======================================================================
Description
======================================================================

The Pf7 data release includes 20,864 parasite samples collected in 33 different countries in Africa, Asia, America and Oceania. From these, 16,203 are high-quality samples with complete metadata. In total, we identified more than 10 million variant positions (SNPs and indels). 

This download includes metadata, genotyping data and drug-resistance inference for samples contributed to MalariaGEN. To encourage specialised analyses, we additionally include the genetic distance matrix, csp c-terminal haplotypes and full gene haplotypes for crt for all the samples in the release.

    - pm2_breakpoint                 Tandem duplication breakpoints around plasmepsin 2-3.

Explanation of amino acid columns in crt, dhfr and dhps:

Each value can have a single haplotype if homozygous or two haplotypes separated by a comma if heterozygous
It is possible to have heterozygous calls where both amino acid haplotypes are the same. The heterozygosity here is at the nucleotide level. These could perhaps be considered homozygous alt.
- represents missing (missing genotype in at least one of the positions)
* represents an unphased het followed by another het. Because hets are unphased it is not possible to resolve the two haplotypes. These are perhaps best considered missing.
! represents a frame-shift in the haplotype. These are perhaps best considered missing.

Explanation of non-synonymous changes (ns_changes): 
Non-synonymous mutations are shown in the form: <REF><POS><ALT>. Homozygous mutations are shown in upper case and heterozygous in lower case. The nomenclature for amino acids described above is also used on this field.

- Pf7_vcf
======================================================================

This directory contains vcf files, one per chromosome. Each file is in bgzip format (.vcf.gz) and has an associated tabix index file (.vcf.gz.tbi). There are sixteen files in total, fourteen for each of the autosomes (Pf3D7_01_v3 - Pf3D7_14_v3), one for the mitochondrial sequence (Pf_M76611) and one for the apicoplast sequence (Pf3D7_API_v3).

The files, once unzipped, are tab-separated text files, but may be too large to open in Excel.

The VCF format is described in https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs

Tools to assist in handling VCF files are freely available from
http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/

The VCF files contains details of 10,145,661 discovered variant genome positions.
These variants were discovered amongst all samples from the release.
4,397,801 of these variant positions are SNPs, with the remainder being either
short insertion/deletions (indels), or a combination of SNPs and indels. It is
important to note that many of these variants are considered low quality. Only
the variants for which the FILTER column is set to PASS should be considered of
reasonable quality. There are 5,868,659 such PASS variants of which 3,125,721
are SNPs and 2,742,938 indels.

The FILTER column is based on two types of information. Firstly certain regions
of the genome are considered "non-core". This includes sub-telomeric regions,
centromeres and internal VAR gene regions on chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8 and 12. All
variants within non-core regions are considered to be low quality, and hence
will not have the FILTER column set to PASS. The regions which are core and
non-core can be found in the file
ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/malaria/pf-crosses/1.0/regions-20130225.onebased.txt.

Secondly, variants are filtered out based on a quality score called VQSLOD. All
variants with a VQSLOD score below 0 are filtered out, i.e. will have a value of
Low_VQSLOD in the FILTER column, rather than PASS. The VQSLOD score for each
variant can be found in the INFO field of the VCF file. It is possible to use
the VQSLOD score to define a more or less stringent set of variants (see next
section for further details).

It is also important to note that many variants have more than two alleles. For
example, amongst the 5,868,659 PASS variants, 2,513,888 are biallelic. The
remaining 611,833 PASS variants have 3 or more alleles. The maximum number of
alternative alleles represented is 6. Note that some positions can in truth have
more than 6 alternative alleles, particularly those at the start of short tandem
repeats. In such cases, some true alternative alleles will be missing.

In addition to alleles representing SNPs and indels, some variants have an
alternative allele denoted by the * symbol. This is used to denote a "spanning
deletion". For samples that have this allele, the base at this position has been
deleted. Note that this is not the same as a missing call - the * denotes that
there are reads spanning across this position, but that the reads have this
position deleted yet map on either side of the deletion. For further details see
https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=6926

In addition to the VQSLOD score mentioned above, The INFO field contains many
other variant-level metrics. The metrics QD, FS, SOR, DP are all measures
related to the quality of the variant. The VQSLOD score is derived from these
five metrics.

AC contains the number of non-reference alleles amongst the samples in the file.
Because the file contains diploid genotype calls, homozygous non-reference calls
will be counted as two non-reference alleles, whereas heterozygous calls will be
counted as one non-reference allele. Where a variant position has more than one
one non-reference allele, counts of each different non-reference allele are
given. AN contains the total number of called alleles, including reference
alleles. A simple non-reference allele frequency can be calculated as AC/AN.
AC and AN values are all specfic to the samples in the study the VCF was created
for.

Various functional annotations are held in the the SNPEFF variables of the INFO
field. Where appropriate, the amino acid change caused by the variant can be
found in SNPEFF_AMINO_ACID_CHANGE. Note that for multi-allelic variants, only
one annotation is given, and therefore this should not be relied on for non-
biallelic variants. SNPEFF_AMINO_ACID_CHANGE also does not take account of
nearby variants, so if two SNPs are present in the same codon, the
amino acid change given is likely to be wrong. Similarly, if two coding indels
are found in the same exon, the SNPEFF annotations are likely to be wrong. This
situation occurs at the CRT locus (see next section for further details).

Coding variants are identified using the CDS flag in the INFO field.

Columns 10 and onwards of the VCF contain the information for each sample.
The first component of this (GT) is always the diploid genotype call as
determined by GATK. A value of 0/0 indicates a homozygous reference call. A
value of 1/1 indicates a homozygous alternative allele call. 0/1 indicates a
heterozygous call. A value of 2 indicates the sample has the second alternative
allele, i.e. the second value in the ALT column. For example 2/2 would mean the
sample is homozygous the the second alternative allele, 0/2 would mean the
sample is heterozygous for the reference and second alternative alleles, and 1/2
would mean the sample is heterozygous for the first and second alternative
alleles. A value of ./. indicates a missing genotype call, usually because there
are no reads mapping at this position in that sample.


Recommendations regarding sets of variants to use in analyses
-------------------------------------------------------------

Variants are filtered using the VQSLOD metric. VQSLOD is log(p/q) where p is the
probability of being true and q is the probability of being false. Theoretically,
when VQSLOD > 0, p is greater than q, and therefore the variant is more likely
true than false. Conversely, when VQSLOD < 0, the variant is theoretically more
like false than true. This is why we have chosen 0 as the threshold to use to
declare that variants have passed the filters: all PASS variants are
theoretically more likely true than false. Of course, for variants where VQSLOD
is only slightly above 0, there is only a slightly greater probability of being
true than of being false. Therefore, for example, many of the variants with
values between 0 and 1 are likely to be false.

Empirically we have found that SNPs tend to be more accurate than indels, coding
variants tend to be more accurate than non-coding variants, and bi-allelic
variants tend to be more accurate than multi-allelic variants. If you require a
very reliable set of variants for genome-wide analysis, and don't mind if you
miss some real variants, we recommend using only bi-allelic coding SNPs in the
core genome with a VQSLOD score > 6. There are 83,168 such stringent SNPs in the
call set. We include a command below to create such a set of variants.

If instead you would like to know of all likely variation within a certain
region, even if this means including a few false variants, we recommend using
all PASS variants. Finally, if you want to ensure you miss as little as possible
of the true variation, at the risk of including large numbers of false positives,
you could ignore the FILTER column and use all variants in the VCF.

In general, we recommend caution in analysing indels. For any given sample, the
majority of differences from the reference genome are likely to be due to indels
in low-complexity non-coding regions, e.g. in length polymorphisms of short
tandem repeats (STRs), such as homopolymer runs or AT repeats. In general, it is
difficult to map short reads reliably in such regions, and this is compounded by
the fact that these regions tend to have high AT content, and in general we
typically have much lower coverage in high AT regions. Indels also tend to be
multi-allelic, making analysis much more challenging than for (typically
bi-allelic) SNPs.

Despite what is written above, it may often be important to analyse indels in
order to determine the true nature of variation at a locus. An example of this
is analysis of haplotypes of codons 72-76 of the chloroquine resistance
transporter gene PfCRT. These codons are translated from bases 403,612-403,626
on chromosome 7 (Pf3D7_07_v3:403612-403626). The vcf contains two indels here,
an insertion of a T after position 403,618, and a deletion of T after position
403,622. However, it turns out that every sample that has the insertion after
403,618 also has the deletion after 403,622. If we write out the full sequence
of the 3D7 reference (Ref), and a sample which has both the insertion and
deletion (Alt), we see the following:
Ref: TGTGTAAT-GAATAAA = TGTGTAATGAATAAA (amino acid sequence CVMNK)
Alt: TGTGTAATTGAA-AAA = TGTGTAATTGAAAAA (amino acid sequence CVIEK)
As can be seen from the above, the single base insertion and deletion are
equivalent to three SNPs at positions 403,620 (G/T), 403,621 (A/G) and
403,623 (T/A). If we had only chosen to analyse SNPs at this locus, we would
not have seen the CVIEK haplotype.


Extracting data from the VCF file
-----------------------------

We recommend the use of bcftools. To install bcftools, follow the instructions
at: https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/wiki/HOWTOs

The following are some commands which you might find useful for extracting data
from the vcf.gz files. We've used an example the vcf for chromosome 5
(Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz), but similar commands should work on all vcf files.

To extract sample IDs and put into a file, one per line:
bcftools query --list-samples Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.final.vcf.gz > samples.txt

To extract chromosome, position, reference allele, all alternate alleles,
filter value and VQSLOD for all variants into a tab-delimited file:
bcftools query -f \
'%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%ALT{1}\t%ALT{2}\t%ALT{3}\t%ALT{4}\t%ALT{5}\t%FILTER\t%VQSLOD\n' \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz > all_variants.txt

To extract chromosome, position, reference allele, all alternate alleles and
VQSLOD for PASS SNPs only into a tab-delimited file:
bcftools query -f \
'%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%ALT{1}\t%ALT{2}\t%ALT{3}\t%ALT{4}\t%ALT{5}\t%VQSLOD\n' \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && TYPE="snp"' \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz > pass_snps.txt

To extract chromosome, position, reference allele, alternate allele and VQSLOD
for biallelic PASS SNPs only into a tab-delimited file:
bcftools query -f \
'%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%VQSLOD\n' \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && TYPE="snp" && N_ALT=1' \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz > biallelic_pass_snps.txt

To extract chromosome, position, reference allele, alternate allele and VQSLOD
for biallelic PASS SNPs that are segregating within the study into a
tab-delimited file:
bcftools query -f \
'%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%VQSLOD\n' \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && TYPE="snp" && N_ALT=1 && AC>0' \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz > biallelic_segregating_pass_snps.txt

To create a vcf file which contains only PASS bi-allelic coding SNPs with
VQSLOD > 6:
bcftools view \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && N_ALT=1 && CDS==1 && TYPE="snp" && VQSLOD>6.0' \
--output-type z \
--output-file output_filename.vcf.gz \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz
bcftools index --tbi output_filename.vcf.gz

To extract diploid genotype calls for biallelic PASS SNPs in gene MDR1 into a
tab-delimited text file, including the chromosome, position, ref and alt
alleles, VQSLOD score and amino acid substituion, and a header containing
sample names:
bcftools query \
-f '%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%VQSLOD\t%SNPEFF_AMINO_ACID_CHANGE[\t%GT]\n' \
--regions Pf3D7_05_v3:957890-962149 \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && TYPE="snp" && N_ALT=1' \
--print-header \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz > mdr1_genotypes.txt

To extract ref allele depths for biallelic PASS SNPs in gene MDR1 into a
tab-delimited text file, including the chromosome, position, ref and alt
alleles, VQSLOD score and amino acid substituion, and a header containing
sample names:
bcftools query \
-f '%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%VQSLOD\t%SNPEFF_AMINO_ACID_CHANGE[\t%AD{0}]\n' \
--regions Pf3D7_05_v3:957890-962149 \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && TYPE="snp" && N_ALT=1' \
--print-header \
Pf_7_public_Pf3D7_05_v3.vcf.gz > mdr1_ref_allele_depth.txt

To extract alt allele depths for biallelic PASS SNPs in gene MDR1 into a
tab-delimited text file, including the chromosome, position, ref and alt
alleles, VQSLOD score and amino acid substituion, and a header containing
sample names:
bcftools query \
-f '%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT{0}\t%VQSLOD\t%SNPEFF_AMINO_ACID_CHANGE[\t%AD{1}]\n' \
--regions Pf3D7_05_v3:957890-962149 \
--include 'FILTER="PASS" && TYPE="snp" && N_ALT=1' \
